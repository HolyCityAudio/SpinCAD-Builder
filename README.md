# SpinCAD-Builder
SpinCAD-Builder is code for a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) written in Xtext, Xtend, and Java.

It is used to generate enhancements to the SpinCAD Designer program to create DSP patches for the Spin FV-1 audio DSP chip. 

This DSL allows people who use SpinCAD Designer to add their own functional blocks to the SpinCAD Designer application, starting with annotated Spin ASM.
